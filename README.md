# FmodRipper

A simple cross-platform command line tool to rip assets out of an FMOD sound bank. It takes a single argument, that is, the full path of the bank file. Using Celeste as an example, a valid path would be
`D:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Celeste\Content\FMOD\Desktop\music.bank`. On windows, you can drag and drop the file over top of the executable to run it (once the prompt says "Open with FmodRipper").
Files will be extracted to a folder with the same name as the bank, for example `D:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Celeste\Content\FMOD\Desktop\music\`.
